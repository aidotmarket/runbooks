# Titan-1 — the Mac Studio (dev workstation + local AI council + MCP host)

Canonical map of the physical machine the whole operation runs from. Live source of the same data: `state_get("infra:titan-1")` (kept in sync with this doc). Related: `connectivity.md` (network), `mcp-gateway.md` (gateway/tunnel detail), `backup-and-recovery.md` (the scheduled jobs), `infisical-secrets.md` (machine-identity creds).

## Identity & hardware
| | |
|---|---|
| Hostname | `Koskadeux.local` |
| Serial | `G6XQC2KL44` (Mac Studio, `Mac15,14`) |
| Chip | Apple M3 Ultra — 32 cores (24 performance + 8 efficiency) |
| Memory | 256 GB unified |
| Disk | 926 GB SSD — data volume ~51% used, ~450 GB free (2026-06-09) |
| OS | macOS 26.5.1 (build 25F80) |
| LAN | 192.168.1.192 · Tailscale node `koskadeux-10` = 100.95.61.121 |

## macOS user accounts

| Account | Purpose | Credential |
|---|---|---|
| `max` | Primary operator account; all agent sessions, Homebrew, repos | Max personal — not stored |
| `kdbrowser` | Isolated test account for human-fidelity browser testing (kd-browser runner, Codex-driven walks; home carries `kd-browser-runner/`) | Infisical `koskadeux-mcp`/prod, path `/`, secret `TITAN_KDBROWSER_PASSWORD` (verified present S1260; value never read out) |

Codex CLI is installed system-wide via Homebrew (`/opt/homebrew/bin/codex`, on PATH for all accounts via `/etc/paths.d/homebrew`); OpenAI login state is per-account under `~/.codex/`. Verified S1260: `kdbrowser` Codex is logged in (ChatGPT auth, `~kdbrowser/.codex/auth.json`). CAVEAT: the kd-browser runner (`127.0.0.1:8790`) launches jobs with a minimal launchd env - job requests must pass `env.PATH` including `/opt/homebrew/bin` or `codex` fails with `env: node: No such file or directory`.

## Role in the ecosystem
Titan-1 is where **the company is actually built and operated**:
- **Local AI council** — the model servers Vulcan/Mars dispatch to (AG/Gemini, DeepSeek, XAI/Grok bridge) run here.
- **MCP orchestration** — the Koskadeux MCP server + gateway run here and are the tool interface both instances use.
- **Local marketplace dev environment** — AIM Data and a local ai-market backend run here in Docker (see Docker stack).
- **Backup origin** — every nightly S3 backup + the watchdog is a launchd job on this machine.
- **Our own data** — our own AIM Data / vectorAIz dev data lives in the local Docker Postgres/Qdrant here, covered by Titan-1's local + physically-separate backup (not S3; customer data is non-custodial).

## Services & ports
| Service | Port | Process | Autostart (LaunchAgent) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Koskadeux MCP server | 8765 (all ifaces) | `koskadeux_server.py` | `com.koskadeux.mcp` | Agent tool interface (the MCP tools) |
| Koskadeux gateway | 8767 (all ifaces) | `gateway_server.py` (under `infisical run`) | `com.koskadeux.gateway` | MCP gateway/proxy — public entry point |
| AG (Gemini) server | 8766 (localhost) | `ag_server.py` | `com.koskadeux.ag_server` | Gemini FastAPI microservice for Council |
| DeepSeek server | 8768 (localhost) | python (under `infisical run`) | `com.koskadeux.deepseek_server` | DeepSeek Council voter |
| Council Hall | internal | python (under `infisical run`) | `com.koskadeux.council-hall` | Multi-agent deliberation backend |
| XAI/Grok bridge | on-demand | `grok_cli_bridge.py` | (on-demand via Council) | Grok CLI bridge for XAI dispatch |
| Antigravity IDE backend | — | `antigravity.py` | `com.max.antigravity` | IDE backend |

Support agents (also launchd): `auto-continue`, `nosleep` (caffeinate), `lilly`, `mcp-probe`, `ide-health`, `fireflies-sync`, `eu_gemini_checker`, `infisical-token-refresh`.

## Public transport (how the outside reaches the gateway)
- **Public path = Cloudflare Tunnel.** `cloudflared tunnel run koskadeux` (config `~/.cloudflared/config.yml`, LaunchAgent `com.koskadeux.cloudflared`) fronts the gateway at **mcp.ai.market**. **Do NOT remove `com.koskadeux.cloudflared`** — it is the live public path.
- **Tailscale = private mesh only.** Node `koskadeux-10`; reaches the laptop (`maxbookpro`) and phone over WireGuard for admin/SSH. The older "Tailscale Funnel" public path (S355) is retired; Cloudflare is the public path now.

## Local Docker stack (the dev marketplace)
| Container | Image | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `aim-data-app-1` | `ghcr.io/aidotmarket/aim-data` | AIM Data app (local) |
| `aim-data-postgres-1` | `postgres:16-alpine` | AIM Data DB (our own dev data) |
| `aim-data-qdrant-1` | `qdrant/qdrant` | AIM Data vector store |
| `ai-market-backend-postgres-1` | `postgres:15-alpine` | local backend Postgres (dev) |
| `crm-gate-postgres` | `postgres:16` | CRM gate DB (local) |
| `gifted_shirley` | `github-mcp-server` | GitHub API for Claude Desktop |
| `buildx_buildkit_aimdata-multi0` | `moby/buildkit` | multi-arch image builder |

## Scheduled jobs (launchd → S3)
nightly main-DB backup, Qdrant backup, Railway-config export, Cloudflare export, the S3 backup watchdog (Telegram alarm), and daily stats. Full label→script→purpose table and the "why everything shows as bash in Login Items" note live in `backup-and-recovery.md`.

## Railway auth / env (machine credential)
Titan-1 reaches Railway (CLI, GraphQL, and the local CLI-backed Railway MCP) with **one account-scoped, non-expiring API token** — minted `titan-1-koskadeux` (Workspace = **No workspace**). It lives **only in Infisical**: project **`koskadeux-mcp`** (projectId `0943f641-faee-4324-b337-0d50c276e4a9`), env `prod`, path `/`, secret name `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN`. Nothing is written to disk. Migrated off Doppler in S993; project/env verified S994.

- **Source it, don't exec it:** `source ~/bin/railway-env.sh`. It refreshes the Infisical machine identity (`infisical_auth_refresh.sh`), fetches `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN`, exports it, and **unsets `RAILWAY_TOKEN`**. `launch_mcp_server.sh` sources it via one guarded line; `railway_client._token()` prefers `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN`, then legacy `RAILWAY_TOKEN`, then `~/.railway/config.json`.
- **Account-scope, NOT workspace-scope:** the token must be account-scoped. Workspace-scoped tokens **403 on CLI account operations** — that was the historical CLI flakiness, and the old workspace-scoped tokens were deleted in S993.
- **`RAILWAY_TOKEN` conflict rule:** a stray `RAILWAY_TOKEN` in the environment overrides `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` and breaks account ops. Always `unset RAILWAY_TOKEN` before CLI commands (railway-env.sh does this for you).
- **Remote MCP is optional:** `mcp.railway.com` (browser OAuth) is **non-load-bearing** — CLI/GraphQL via the Infisical token is the load-bearing path.
- **Gotcha:** bare `python`/urllib calls to `backboard.railway.app` 403 on a Cloudflare UA block — not an auth failure; `railway_client` uses `httpx`, which works.

Live machine-readable source: `state_get("infra:railway")` → `management_tools.machine_identity`.

## Incident record — 2026-07-04 reboot outage (S1118) + cold-start canary rule

**What happened:** Apple OS patch rebooted Titan-1. All com.koskadeux.* LaunchAgents are
correctly RunAtLoad+KeepAlive and restarted — but the gateway crash-looped (exit 1):
`gateway_server.py` imports `ContentBlock`/`Icon` from `mcp.types`, and the venv held
`mcp==1.8.1` (silently downgraded/reinstalled ~Jul 3 12:36 local, source unattributed;
`requirements.txt` had an unpinned `mcp` line). The old process had the newer SDK in
memory, so nothing failed until the cold start. Public symptom: Cloudflare 502 on
mcp.ai.market (tunnel up, origin :8767 down). Fix: `venv/bin/pip install -U mcp`
(→1.28.1) + kickstart; floor now pinned in requirements.txt (commit d92a15b1).

**Rule — cold-start import canary:** after ANY dependency change in the koskadeux venv
(pip install/upgrade/downgrade, requirements edit, venv rebuild), run:
`for m in koskadeux_server gateway_server ag_server deepseek_server; do venv/bin/python -c "import $m" || echo "$m FAILS COLD-START"; done`
A running process proves nothing about the next reboot. Note: importing koskadeux_server
applies pending registry migrations (side effect; idempotent).

**Fast triage for "MCP unreachable after reboot":** probe `https://mcp.ai.market/health`
from anywhere — 530/1033 = tunnel down (cloudflared, system daemon); 502 = tunnel up,
gateway :8767 down (check `/var/tmp/koskadeux/gateway.err`); 200 = path fine, look
higher. Local: `curl 127.0.0.1:{8765,8767}/health`; kickstart:
`launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.koskadeux.<svc>`.
