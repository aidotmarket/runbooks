# Publish Paths Runbook

How a dataset becomes a marketplace listing. There is exactly one publish route; everything else is management or has been removed.

## §A. Header

- **Owns:** the single canonical publish path and the rules that keep it single.
- **Status:** current as of the wizard removal (S1077). Website publish wizards deleted; their five tables dropped in production.
- **Source of truth:** `config:publish-paths-consolidation-tracker` (program state); this runbook (operating model); `account-capability-onboarding.md` (the active-seller gate). When reality and this runbook disagree, fix the runbook in the same change.

### M1 — Dependencies & Credentials / Source-of-Truth
- **Canonical endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/vz/publish` → `vz_publish_service.create_or_update_listing` (ai-market-backend). Ed25519 trust-token signed; enforces the active-seller capability gate.
- **Listings store:** the `listings` table (Postgres). Same table for every product; no per-product listing store.
- **Gate dependency:** `assert_user_capability(user, db, 'seller', 'active')` — see `account-capability-onboarding.md`.

## §B. Capability Matrix

| Actor | Can create/publish a listing? | How |
|-------|------|-----|
| AIM Data (customer install) | Yes | Signs an EdDSA JWT and proxies to `POST /api/v1/vz/publish` |
| vectorAIz | Yes | Calls `POST /api/v1/vz/publish` directly |
| Agent / programmatic (REST `/actions/execute`, `/mcp tools/call`, Trust Channel) | Yes, gated | Reaches `aim.listing.*` only through the ActionExecutorService chokepoint, which enforces the same active-seller gate |
| The website (ai.market dashboard) | No | Manage only: see-my-listings, preview, unpublish, delete |

## §C. Architecture & Interactions

One write path, one gate. Both customer products (AIM Data, vectorAIz) publish through `POST /api/v1/vz/publish`, which is the only place a new listing is created or a listing is set to published, and it always runs the active-seller check first. The agent/programmatic surfaces do not have their own publish code; they pass through the ActionExecutorService chokepoint, which carries the same gate. The website never creates or publishes — it reads and manages listings that already exist on the canonical `listings` table through `listings.py` (`GET /listings/mine`, `GET /listings/{id}/preview`, `POST /listings/{id}/unpublish`, `DELETE /listings/{id}`). Unpublish is a retraction: it delists and de-indexes, and does not fire publish-effect hooks (no translation outbox, no search submission).

## §D. Agent Capability Map
- **allAI** generates and classifies the listing metadata that is sent to the canonical endpoint. It does not itself publish.
- **No agent has a private publish path.** Any agent publish flows through the gated chokepoint above.

## §E. Operate — Serving Customers
- **E-01 — A customer publishes via AIM Data:** the install signs a token and proxies to `POST /api/v1/vz/publish`. A non-active seller is rejected by the gate.
- **E-02 — A customer publishes via vectorAIz:** same endpoint, called directly.
- **E-03 — A seller manages an existing listing on the website:** preview, unpublish, or delete through `listings.py`. Ownership is enforced (a non-owner gets a 404).
- **E-04 — A seller wants to publish from the website:** there is no such action by design. Direct them to AIM Data or vectorAIz.

## §F. Isolate — Diagnosing Deviations
- **A listing was published without an active seller:** a publish path is bypassing the gate. The gate lives at `vz_publish_service.create_or_update_listing` and at the ActionExecutorService chokepoint. Any new code that sets `status='published'` outside those is a defect.
- **A new "publish" route appears:** it must route through the canonical endpoint or the gated chokepoint. A standalone publish route is a regression of this consolidation.
- **Unpublish triggered translation/search side-effects:** unpublish must be retraction-only; a publish-effect hook firing on unpublish is a defect.

## §G. Repair — Fixing Problems
- **G-01 — Close an ungated publish path:** route it through `vz_publish_service.create_or_update_listing`, or gate it with `assert_user_capability(..., 'seller', 'active')` at the chokepoint. Never add a second ungated writer.
- **G-02 — Roll back the wizard removal (if ever needed):** the drop migration `s1077_drop_publish_wizard_tables` has a downgrade that recreates the five tables (empty). Reversal is schema-level only; it does not restore data (there was none — pre-launch).

## §H. Evolve — Extending the System

### §H.1 Invariants
- One publish route. New products publish through `POST /api/v1/vz/publish`, never a new endpoint.
- One gate. Every publish-effect path enforces the active-seller capability check.
- The website never creates or publishes.
- Unpublish is retraction-only.

### Change-class examples
- **Add a new data product that lists to the marketplace:** point it at `POST /api/v1/vz/publish`. No new publish code.
- **Add an agent publish capability:** add it under `aim.listing.*` so it inherits the chokepoint gate by construction.

## §I. Acceptance Criteria (scenario set)
- A non-active seller is rejected on every publish path (vz/publish, AIM Data proxy, vectorAIz, agent surfaces).
- The website exposes no create/publish action; manage actions enforce ownership.
- No live code outside the canonical writer / gated chokepoint sets a listing to published.
- Unpublish does not fire publish-effect hooks.

## §J. Lifecycle
- **Removed (S1077):** the two website publish wizards (`seller_wizard`, `publish_wizard`) — endpoints, services, model, schema, and their five tables (`publish_operations`, `publish_audit_log`, `hitl_tokens`, `pii_findings`, `replay_nonces`). Verified absent in production; alembic head `s1077_drop_publish_wizard_tables`.
- **Transient cutover note:** during consolidation an older `POST /api/v1/listings/` push and the website wizards coexisted with the canonical path. The website wizards are now gone. Two legacy server surfaces remain and are retired by separate, already-planned phases: `publish.py POST /listings/publish` (BQ-D2 safe-delete) and `listings.py POST /listings/` (active-seller gated today, retired as a product publish route by the AIM Data migration).

## §K. Conformance
- The single-path and single-gate invariants are enforced by tests in ai-market-backend (`test_publish_paths_phase3_rehome.py` and the vz/publish + chokepoint gate suites). Adding a publish-effect path without the gate should fail review.
