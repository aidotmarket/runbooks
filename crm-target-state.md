# CRM Target-State Runbook — System Standard

> **Purpose**: This document is the authoritative specification for the ai.market CRM system. Every feature described here must (a) work as specified, (b) have automated test coverage, (c) be accessible to the CRM steward agent, and (d) expose integration interfaces for Accounting, Support, and Sales systems. If the system diverges from this document, the system is wrong.

> **Status**: R6 — 2026-04-24. R6 refresh (S500): integrated S499 emergency-data findings into a coherent known-bug surface. Changes: (a) Phase 3.5 added to §7 to track BQ-CRM-USER-SCOPING-BACKFILL-AND-FALLBACK; (b) §6 expanded with the user-scoping wipeout, steward dispatch gaps D10/D11/D12, and OPUS_CRM audit issues 1–7; (c) §2.3 and §2.10 mark voice memo ingest as Removed (S499 decision, C02); (d) §3 skill count corrected from 16→28 decorated skills in `crm_steward_skills.py` with public/internal re-audit pending under D07; (e) Appendix B retires `crm_agent_request.py` and redirects the natural-language agent surface to MCP `crm_remote.py`; (f) §7 Phase 4 BQ statuses refreshed (AGENT-COVERAGE → REDIRECT STUB to COMPOSITE-SKILLS per S474; SALES-SURFACE B2 shipped S481 `8315c11`). **S500 amendment (2026-04-24)**: C02 voice memo removal narrowed to CRM surface only; Telegram voice ingest (`voice_transcription_service.py`, `telegram_relay.py:185`, `webhooks.py:1816`) preserved per CC Gate 1 Q3 finding (validated by MP R1 task `80089f05`) — see BQ body.c02_narrowing_s500. Prior R5 (S469, 2026-04-18): marked **BQ-CRM-INTEGRATION-CONTRACTS** DONE after Gate 4 close in S469 (backend commit `1d27532`), updated §4.1 Accounting to shipped `/api/v1/accounting/crm` contracts and canonical Stripe Connect identity guidance, removed stale in-flight references, refreshed §7 to Tier 2 Gate 1 R1 parallel-lane reality, and added capability-horizon references for `BQ-MEET-RECORDS-CRM` and `BQ-CRM-REFERRAL-TRACKING`. BQ-CRM-RUNBOOK-STANDARD.

> **Status R10 — 2026-06-29 (S1059)**: Owner-scope-removal sub-program (`build:bq-crm-v2-phase-d-owner-scope-removal-s1043`) SHIPPED — Gate-4 merged to main `1ed5309f` (FF c07983e7..1ed5309f) and deployed flags OFF (Railway `5b321bd0` SUCCESS, /health green, CRM endpoints 401). Removed ~30 legacy per-user owner-scope filter predicates on `CRMPerson`/`CRMOrganization` across 5 files (single-operator); interaction + task-assignment scoping + write-provenance preserved. CI 854 passed on real PG (the 4 failures are pre-existing on the `c07983e7` baseline, not caused by this change); role-authority lint pass; M5 residual + A7 indirect-helper greps EMPTY. `CRM_V2_READ_PERSON`/`CRM_V2_READ_ORGANIZATION` flags unchanged (OFF) — no read-flag flip. See §7 Phase D.
> **Status R11 — 2026-06-29 (S1062)**: First person/org read-routing chunk (briefing — `build:bq-crm-v2-phase-d-read-routing-chunk-briefing-s1061`) ACTIVATED. The 3 data-returning person/org reads in `crm_briefing_service_gmail.py` were routed to the S1040 party scaffold (merged `ea0f2215`, prod `a61159c0`); after exhaustive full-dataset parity against real prod (384 people + 29 orgs, zero dangerous mismatches), `CRM_V2_READ_PERSON` + `CRM_V2_READ_ORGANIZATION` were flipped to `party_first` on Railway (deploy `c0b5d8b4` SUCCESS, /health green). Legacy fallback retained; instant rollback (set legacy/unset). See §7 Phase D.
> **Status R12 — 2026-06-29 (S1062)**: Second person-read CONVERT chunk shipped (`build:bq-crm-v2-phase-d-read-routing-chunk-gmail-draft-s1062`). Routed the single person get-by-id in `gmail_draft_service._resolve_contact_email` to the scaffold `get_person_by_id` with retained legacy `select(CRMPerson)` fallback (merged `40d8eb84`, Railway `43b64eef` SUCCESS, /health green). No new flag — `CRM_V2_READ_PERSON` was already `party_first` in prod (R11), so the wiring activates on deploy; person-family parity already proven. Right-sized ceremony per `config:ceremony-sizing-policy`: MP build + one independent reviewer (AG APPROVE, no findings), 5 routing tests green. See §7 Phase D.
> **Status R9 — 2026-06-27 (S1048)**: §7 Phase D updated for the person/org read-path scaffold (S1040, shipped inert @`5c0717b3`) and the new-family read-flag default fix (S1046, @`cb305cc1`). Added the **GLOBAL_DEFAULT_FAMILIES invariant**: a newly added CRM read family defaults to `legacy` and is added to `GLOBAL_DEFAULT_FAMILIES` only on a deliberate global cutover. `person`/`organization` are deliberately excluded — they stay legacy until an explicit per-family var (`CRM_V2_READ_PERSON`/`CRM_V2_READ_ORGANIZATION`) is set, and will NOT auto-activate on a global flip.
> **Status R8 — 2026-06-27 (S1038)**: Added Chunk 3 (`endpoints/crm.py` task-family reads `get_entity_context`+`admin_list_pending_tasks` party-routed, shipped @`2beb477b`; Gate-3 access-regression PASS 45==45, no backfill). See §7 Phase D.
> **Status R7 — 2026-06-26 (S1037)**: Added §7 Phase D (CRM V2 legacy read-elimination + table drop) documenting the program, the repeatable per-chunk procedure incl. the Gate-3 access-regression audit (Audit A/B) + conditional access-preserving backfill, and Chunk 1 (shipped S1025) + Chunk 2 (`app/api/deps.py` party-only ownership guards, shipped S1037 @28e4be14). Canonical status tracker: `config:crm-phase-d-tracker`.

> Tier status is tracked in Living State entity `config:crm-operational-plan`. This runbook is the stable target-state; Living State is the dynamic status tracker.

## 1. System Boundary & Identity Model

### What the CRM Is
The CRM is ai.market's system of record for **people, organizations, relationships, interactions, tasks, pipeline stages, referrals, outreach, and commissions**. It is consumed by:
- **Max** (via morning briefing, ops dashboard, Claude deep links)
- **AI Agents** (CRM steward, briefing monitors, marketing ops)
- **MCP tool surface** (Koskadeux `crm_request` and related tools)
- **External systems** (future: Accounting, Support, Sales automation)

### What the CRM Is Not
The CRM does not manage: marketplace listings, AIM Node sessions, VZ deployment state, or user authentication. Those are separate domains with their own systems of record.

### Canonical Identifiers
| ID | Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `entity_id` | V1 CRM | Primary key for persons, organizations in `crm_entities` |
| `party_id` | V2 CRM | Canonical cross-domain identity — target state for all integrations |
| `task_id` | Tasks | Action item tracking, HITL workflow |
| `draft_id` | Drafts | Email draft lifecycle |
| `interaction_id` | Interactions | Communication log entries |
| `referral_id` | Referrals | Referral + commission tracking |
| `opportunity_id` | V2 Commercial | Deal/opportunity tracking |
| `pipeline_stage_id` | Pipeline | Stage positioning |

### V1/V2 Bridge State
The current system runs V1 (crm_entities/crm_persons/crm_organizations) as the active production path. V2 (party/party_identity/party_role_binding) models exist with dual-write columns. **Target state after current BQs**: V1 remains primary for operations; V2 `party_id` becomes the canonical external identifier for integration contracts. Full V1→V2 migration is a future BQ.

### 2.12 Customer Support / allAI First-Responder (NEW S458)

Per Max's directive: *AI handles all customer interactions unless human risk management is needed.* The allAI first-responder model treats CRM-backed support as a default-AI flow with explicit escalation paths.

| Feature | Status | BQ | Agent | Tests | Integration |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Natural-language CRM request dispatch (`crm_request`) | Working | DONE (AGENT-DISPATCH-FIX, AGENT-LLM-TOOL-USE, ALLAI-SKILL-REGISTRATION) | Yes — full multi-turn tool use verified in prod S458 | Covered (`test_crm_agent_dispatch_malformed.py`, `test_crm_agent_end_to_end_tool_use.py`, `test_base_agent_skill_registration.py`) | Su |
| Dispatch layer honest-envelope contract | Working | DONE (AGENT-DISPATCH-FIX) | — | Covered | All |
| Tool-use protocol prompt + tool_choice injection | Working | DONE (AGENT-LLM-TOOL-USE) | — | Covered | All |
| Skill registration lazy-fill at read boundary | Working | DONE (ALLAI-SKILL-REGISTRATION) | — | Covered | All |
| allAI-first support intake and triage | Planned | SUPPORT-WORKFLOWS (Gate 1 R1 draft) | Planned | Gap | Su |
| Dispute resolution workflow | Planned | SUPPORT-WORKFLOWS (Gate 1 R1 draft; from ENTERPRISE-FEATURES carve-out) | No | Gap | Su |
| SLA tracking on support tasks | Planned | SUPPORT-WORKFLOWS (Gate 1 R1 draft) | No | Gap | Su |
| Ticket ↔ CRM linkage | Planned | SUPPORT-WORKFLOWS (Gate 1 R1 draft) | No | Gap | Su |
| Human escalation signal | Planned | SUPPORT-WORKFLOWS (Gate 1 R1 draft) | Planned | Gap | Su |
| Meet notes ingestion to CRM (Google Drive → Meet Gemini Notes) | Planned | BQ-MEET-RECORDS-CRM (T4 horizon) | No | Gap | Su |

**Design principle**: Every support interaction starts with allAI. Escalation to Max happens only when (a) risk/compliance signal requires human judgment, (b) AI confidence below threshold, or (c) the counterparty explicitly requests human contact. See §4.2 for the integration contract.

**Verification evidence (S458)**: Live read trace `754792b8-efd8-4270-8415-96d916e40fa2` (find_contact), live write trace `dffad565-0cf8-4014-910d-6ed2b1fb7f3a` (create_task via 2-turn tool use, task UUID `d0b11969-28dc-4bf8-aec3-e11340e6ef56`). See Event Ledger entry `885de070-6fa5-4142-a4db-77d6bee11d22`.

## 3. CRM Steward — Agent Capability Map

### Current Skills (28 `@skill`-decorated in `crm_steward_skills.py`; public/internal classification pending re-audit under BQ-CRM-USER-SCOPING D07)

**Published public skills** (accessible via MCP/API/Telegram):
- `find_contact` — search contacts by name/email/query
- `upsert_contact` — create or update contact (matches by email then name)
- `add_note` — log interaction/note against entity
- `create_task` — create follow-up task with dedup
- `create_organization` — create/upsert organization by name
- `create_relationship` — link two CRM entities
- `complete_task` — mark task completed
- `snooze_task` — postpone task to future date
- `move_contact_forward` — push open tasks forward N days + reset last-contact
- `get_daily_briefing` — user-scoped daily CRM briefing
- `get_entity_context` — full entity context (interactions, relationships, tasks)

**Additional internal skills** (in manifest but not public):
- `add_prospect` — multi-step contact creation flow
- `draft_email` — email drafting via approval pipeline
- `log_note` — add note to existing contact
- `search_contacts` — search by name/company/email
- `general_chat` — general CRM-aware conversation

**Decorated service-bus skills NOT exposed** (in `crm_steward_skills.py`):
- `update_contact`, `update_person`, `delete_entity`
- Pipeline move/query skills
- Referral management skills
- Research/enrichment skills
- Admin/import skills

### Target State: Full Agent Coverage

After BQ-CRM-AGENT-COVERAGE, the steward MUST be able to:

1. **Contact ops**: Create, read, update, soft-delete persons and organizations. Search by any field. Merge duplicates.
2. **Relationship ops**: Create, read, delete relationships. Query entity network. (Partially done via `create_relationship` + `get_entity_context`)
3. **Interaction ops**: Log any type. Search/filter interactions. Trigger email ingest manually.
4. **Task ops**: Full lifecycle — create, complete, cancel, snooze, reassign. Query pending/overdue/snoozed.
5. **Pipeline ops**: Move contacts through stages. Bulk moves. Query stage analytics.
6. **Referral ops**: Create, track, close referrals. Query commission status.
7. **Outreach ops**: Generate outreach drafts. Assemble context. Trigger research enrichment.
8. **Briefing ops**: Trigger on-demand briefing. Query briefing data.
9. **Admin ops**: Import contacts. Seed pipeline stages. Run data integrity checks.

### Skill Gap Closure Plan
Each gap maps to BQ-CRM-AGENT-COVERAGE (expanded from COMPOSITE-SKILLS). Depends on SERVICE-LAYER landing first (single write path). Test suite must include agent-level integration tests: steward skill → service → database → verified outcome.

---

## 4. Integration Contracts

### 4.1 Accounting Interface

**What Accounting needs from CRM**:
- Commission accruals and settlement events (via V2 `commission_accrual`)
- Referral close events with commission amounts
- Pipeline stage-change events (for revenue recognition timing)
- Party identity resolution (`party_id` ↔ Stripe customer/connect account)

**Current state (R5 / shipped in `ai-market-backend@main` as of `1d27532`)**:
- Read-only contract surface is live at `app/api/v1/endpoints/accounting_crm.py` under `/api/v1/accounting/crm`, protected by `require_accounting_scope("accounting:read")`.
- Shipped endpoints: `GET /commission-accruals/{transaction_id}`, `GET /commission-accruals`, `GET /referrals/{referral_id}`, `GET /referrals`, `GET /party-stripe-mappings/{party_id}`, `GET /party-stripe-mappings/by-customer/{stripe_customer_id}`, and `GET /party-stripe-mappings/by-connect-account/{stripe_connect_account_id}`.
- Shipped schemas live in `app/schemas/accounting_crm.py`: `CommissionAccrualRead` / `CommissionAccrualList`, `ReferralCommissionRead` / `ReferralCommissionList`, and `PartyStripeMappingRead`.
- Seller-side Stripe Connect is now canonically read from `party_identity(provider='stripe_connect')`. Legacy `users.stripe_account_id` and `seller_profiles.stripe_connect_id` remain dual-written by existing writers, but new code must not add fresh reads from those columns; readers go through `app/services/crm/stripe_connect_identity_reader.py`.
- M7 inter-chunk gate validated the consolidation on real sandbox Stripe Connect onboarding in S468: DB evidence on `acct_1TNbCtRoppdDnnXZ` showed `party_identity` byte-exact with `users.stripe_account_id`, with idempotency confirmed.
- Canonical implementation spec: `specs/BQ-CRM-INTEGRATION-CONTRACTS-GATE2.md` at backend commit `8c298dc`.
- Explicitly out of scope: `billing_entities` and other merchant-of-record semantics remain separate; do not treat them as present in this CRM contract.

**Contract**: Shipped read-only REST endpoints for CRM/accounting queries now exist. Event-driven TX wiring still exists where noted below, but canonical transaction → CRM dispatch is not yet the external contract surface.

| Event/Endpoint | Exists | Stable API | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Commission accrual created/settled | Yes (V2 TX + shipped read endpoints) | Yes — `/api/v1/accounting/crm/commission-accruals*` | P1 |
| Referral closed with commission | Yes (service + shipped read endpoints) | Yes — `/api/v1/accounting/crm/referrals*` | P1 |
| Pipeline stage changed | Yes (service) | No — no event hook | P2 |
| Party ↔ Stripe mapping | Yes (`party_identity`) | Yes — `/api/v1/accounting/crm/party-stripe-mappings*` | P1 |
| Revenue summary by period | No | No | P2 |
| Formal referral attribution / payout workflow | Planned | No | T4 horizon — `BQ-CRM-REFERRAL-TRACKING` |

### 4.2 Support Interface (allAI-first design, S458 R4)

**Design principle** (per §2.12): Every support interaction is handled by allAI first. Human escalation only when risk/compliance requires judgment, AI confidence is below threshold, or the counterparty explicitly requests human contact.

**What Support needs from CRM**:
- Natural-language task dispatch via `crm_request` (verified S458) — the primary entry point
- Contact/org lookup by any identifier (for lookups AI needs to perform)
- Interaction history for a contact (for AI context assembly)
- Trust score and infraction history (for risk-weighting AI decisions)
- Task creation for support follow-ups
- Dispute → infraction pipeline (with HITL approval)
- Human escalation signal + audit trail (when AI escalates, we record why)

**Contract**: Agent-first — `crm_request` is the default support surface. REST endpoints remain available for internal/admin and as the underlying service layer the agent calls.

| Event/Endpoint | Exists | Stable API | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `crm_request` natural-language dispatch | Yes (S458) | Yes (MCP + REST) | — | Primary support surface; handles ~90% of support flows |
| Contact lookup (email, name) | Yes | Yes (REST) | — | Agent skill `find_contact` |
| Contact lookup by party_id | Yes | No — service helper only | P1 | Target: expose via REST and agent skill |
| Interaction history | Yes | Yes (REST) | — | Agent skill `get_entity_context` |
| Trust score snapshot | Yes (V2) | No | P1 | Target: expose via REST + agent skill `get_trust_score` |
| Infraction log | Yes (V2) | No | P1 | Target: expose via REST + agent skill `list_infractions` |
| Create support task | Yes | Yes (REST) | — | Agent skill `create_task` |
| Dispute resolution workflow | No | No | P1 | BQ-CRM-SUPPORT-WORKFLOWS (promoted P2→P1 per S458 direction) |
| SLA tracking on support tasks | No | No | P1 | BQ-CRM-SUPPORT-WORKFLOWS |
| Ticket ↔ CRM linkage | No | No | P1 | BQ-CRM-SUPPORT-WORKFLOWS |
| Human escalation signal | No | No | P1 | BQ-CRM-SUPPORT-WORKFLOWS — emit `agent_escalation_requested` event with reason + confidence + trace_id |

**Agent-first acceptance criteria**: For every row above where `Stable API = Yes`, the CRM steward must be able to invoke it via `crm_request`. For rows marked P1, BQ-CRM-SUPPORT-WORKFLOWS must either ship the REST+agent skill or declare a carved-out follow-on BQ.

### 4.3 Sales Interface

**What Sales needs from CRM**:
- Full contact/org/relationship graph
- Pipeline management (move, bulk move, analytics)
- Outreach generation and context
- Referral tracking
- Research enrichment
- Briefing data

**Contract**: REST endpoints + agent skills for automated sales workflows.

| Event/Endpoint | Exists | Stable API | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Contact/org create/list/search/get | Yes | Yes (REST) | — |
| Contact/org update/delete | Yes | No — admin-internal only (`crm.py:744`) | P1 |
| Pipeline CRUD + analytics | Yes | Yes (REST, full suite) | — |
| Outreach generation | Broken | No | P1 |
| Research enrichment | Broken | No | P2 |
| Referral CRUD | Yes | Yes (REST) | — |
| Relationship graph query | Yes | Yes (via entity context) | — |

---

## 5. Test Standard & Acceptance Matrix

### Principle
Every row in the Capabilities Matrix (Section 2) must have at least one automated test that validates the feature works end-to-end. The test name must reference the capability ID (e.g., `test_2_1_create_person`, `test_2_5_pipeline_move`).

### Current Coverage
- **439+ CRM-related tests** across the repo (including pipeline, referral, steward, service, MCP, soft-delete, FTS, briefing)
- **Well covered**: Core CRUD, steward skills, V2 identity/trust/revenue, referral basics + commission, auth guardrails, briefing skill, soft-delete constraints, org operations, entity network, cancel task
- **Gaps**: CRM pipeline service/endpoints (no dedicated test file), outreach generation/context, research service, briefing delivery/data assembly, draft service, admin/import/dedup, outbound Gmail, voice memo, V2 operations against real DB with non-null entity_id, steward→V2 integration, agent-level integration tests
- **Quarantined**: `test_crm_auth.py`, `test_crm_steward_retrofit.py` (skill-count drift), `test_gmail_drafts.py` (skipped)

### Test Tiers
1. **Unit tests**: Each service method, each model validation rule
2. **Integration tests**: Service → database round-trip, soft-delete filtering, dedup behavior
3. **Agent tests**: Steward skill → service → database → verified outcome
4. **Contract tests**: Each integration endpoint returns expected schema
5. **Regression tests**: Every bug fixed by DATA-INTEGRITY, BRIEFING-FIX, SERVICE-LAYER, AUTH-RBAC

### Gap Closure Plan
BQ-CRM-TESTING-V2 (reopen of CRM-TESTING) generates tests for every "Gap" cell in Section 2. Starts immediately; closes only after SERVICE-LAYER and broken-service fixes land. Target: 80% coverage floor with explicit per-feature acceptance.

---

## 6. Known Broken/Partial Items Requiring Immediate Fix

1. **Outreach generation broken**: `outreach_generation_service.py:37` maps to `CRMTaskType.FOLLOW_UP_EMAIL` which doesn't exist as an enum → **BQ-CRM-FIX-OUTREACH**
2. **V2 operations not production-safe**: `domains/crm/operations/service.py:33` doesn't set `entity_id` despite non-null constraint on `CRMInteraction.entity_id` and `CRMTask.entity_id` → **BQ-CRM-FIX-V2-OPS**
3. **Research backfill broken**: `crm_research_service.py:645` writes `last_researched_at` to `CRMPerson` but field is on `CRMOrganization` → **BQ-CRM-FIX-RESEARCH**
4. **Steward skill fragmentation**: 28 `@skill`-decorated methods in `crm_steward_skills.py`, 11 published public — public/internal classification pending re-audit under D07 → **BQ-CRM-AGENT-COVERAGE** (formerly BQ-CRM-COMPOSITE-SKILLS, absorbed BQ-CRM-PATCH-PARITY per S456 audit; skill count corrected from 16→28 per S500 R6 refresh + S691 §6 row sync)
5. **Briefing split-brain**: Gmail-based sender (`crm_briefing_service_gmail.py`) vs Postmark delivery (`briefing_delivery.py:185`) running in parallel → **BQ-CRM-BRIEFING-FIX slice 1**
6. **SERVICE-LAYER Gate 1 defers endpoint bypasses**: Some API endpoints bypass service layer; not true single-write-path until Gate 2 lands (`BQ-CRM-SERVICE-LAYER-GATE1.md:61`)
7. **User-scoping data wipeout** (FIXED S499 Track 1 data restoration; SYSTEMIC FIX PENDING): user-scoped briefing queries returned empty because `created_by_user_id` was null on 550+ rows — 369 `crm_people`, 26 `crm_organizations`, 54 `crm_tasks` (including 7 placeholder UUIDs rewritten), 101 `crm_interactions`. Track 1 restored all rows on production via atomic SQL on 2026-04-24. Track 2 (D01–D12) wires an Alembic migration to replace the SQL (idempotent, reversible, self-healing on backup-restored DBs), adds CI lint on scoping columns, adds defensive service fallbacks on empty-scoped-query + zero-owned, adds regression tests, adds `crm_briefing_contact_count` metric + alarm, closes steward ownership-scoping TODOs at `crm_steward_skills.py:533,668`, and audits other scoping columns since Jan. Track 3 (C01–C07) cleans up the empty `crm-mcp-server` dir, removes `CRMVoiceMemoService` entirely, audits `crm_pipeline_stages` empty-despite-seed, audits `briefing_data_service.py` + `/api/v1/briefing` for vestigial-vs-active, adds a placeholder-UUID regression test, confirms deprecated endpoints removed. Tracked in **BQ-CRM-USER-SCOPING-BACKFILL-AND-FALLBACK**.
8. **Steward natural-language dispatch + command layer incomplete** (blocks Max's goal of using CRM via Claude + MP Mac clients for full read/write): `_dispatch_by_intent` in `app/allai/agents/crm_steward.py` does not invoke `CRMAIService` for free-text intent routing (OPUS_CRM Issue 4 / D10); `_cmd_task`, `_cmd_drafts`, `_cmd_draft`, `_cmd_reject` are stubs without real service calls (Issue 5 / D11); `_handle_draft_email_step` + `_handle_confirm_draft_step` are not implemented (Issue 6 / D12).
9. **Alembic migration ordering for `allai_event_ledger.dedupe_key`**: `alembic/versions/20260424_001_add_allai_event_ledger_dedupe_key.py` has `down_revision = s155_crm_sales_surface_outbox`, but the table is created on a different branch — `tests/test_crm_support_api.py` setup errors with "relation allai_event_ledger does not exist" (OPUS_CRM Issue 1 / D08).
10. **Test-brittle hardcoded date** in `tests/test_crm_agent_request_endpoint.py` fails on any day after the hardcoded `2026-04-22T09:00:00Z` (OPUS_CRM Issue 2 / D09).

## 7. Migration & Consolidation Plan

### Target Architecture
```
domains/crm/
  core/         — identity (party), contacts, organizations, relationships, audit
  operations/   — interactions, tasks, task lifecycle, voice memos
  commercial/   — pipeline, referrals, opportunities, outreach
  revenue/      — commission engine (plans, rules, overrides, accruals)
  trust/        — scoring, infractions, dispute resolution
  briefing/     — daily/weekly briefing (data assembly + render + delivery)
  ai/           — research, enrichment, draft generation, AI classification
  integration/  — Accounting, Support, Sales contracts and event hooks
```

### Phase Plan (R5 refresh — S469)

**Phase 0 — Unblock the Agent (COMPLETE S457–S458)**:
- ✅ BQ-CRM-AGENT-DISPATCH-FIX (S457, commit f743704) — honest envelope
- ✅ BQ-CRM-AGENT-LLM-TOOL-USE (S458, commits 382dbc2 + 94c23b8 + db6c386) — tool-use protocol prompt + tool_choice injection
- ✅ BQ-ALLAI-SKILL-REGISTRATION (S458, commit 0479940) — lazy-fill at read boundary
- Net result: `crm_request` fully functional end-to-end; memory edit #15 lifted

**Phase 1 — Core CRM hygiene (COMPLETE through R4)**:
- ✅ DATA-INTEGRITY (multiple slices)
- ✅ AUTH-RBAC
- ✅ SERVICE-LAYER
- ✅ BRIEFING-FIX (both slices)
- ✅ This runbook R4 refresh

**Phase 2 — Stable integration contract (COMPLETE S469)**:
1. ✅ **BQ-CRM-INTEGRATION-CONTRACTS** — Gate 4 closed in S469 after backend landing through commit `1d27532`
2. Net result: Accounting-facing CRM read contracts are live under `/api/v1/accounting/crm/*`; seller-side Stripe Connect reads consolidate on `party_identity(provider='stripe_connect')`

**Phase 3 — Fix broken services (still in progress)**:
1. **3 micro-BQs for broken services** (parallel): BQ-CRM-FIX-OUTREACH, BQ-CRM-FIX-V2-OPS, BQ-CRM-FIX-RESEARCH

**Phase 3.5 — CRM user-scoping systemic fix (ACTIVE S500)**:
1. **BQ-CRM-USER-SCOPING-BACKFILL-AND-FALLBACK** (P0). Gate 0 planned. Track 1 (emergency data restoration) complete S499 — 550 rows backfilled via atomic SQL on Railway Postgres (data-only, not in repo by design). Track 2 (D01–D12 systemic: Alembic migration replacing the SQL, CI lint, service fallback, regression tests, alarm, steward dispatch/command layer, ownership-scoping audit across `crm_interactions`/`crm_playbooks`/`crm_learned_preferences`/`crm_audit_log`, Alembic/test-brittleness fixes) + Track 3 (C01–C07 cleanup: empty MCP dir, voice memo removal, pipeline seed audit, briefing dashboard audit, placeholder-UUID regression, deprecated endpoints confirmation) pending. Blocks full unlock of Max's goal to use CRM via Claude + MP Mac clients.

**Phase 4 — Tier 2 parallel lane (next per `config:crm-operational-plan`)**:
1. **BQ-CRM-AGENT-COVERAGE** — REDIRECT STUB → **BQ-CRM-COMPOSITE-SKILLS** (canonical per S474 consolidation). Composite skills Chunk A + Chunk B2 COMPLETE (4 composite steward skills + 2 MCP write tools + alias canonicalization); Chunk C decided NOT_APPLICABLE; Chunk D PII hardening carved to separate **BQ-CRM-COMPOSITE-SKILLS-PII-HARDENING** (P2).
2. **BQ-CRM-SALES-SURFACE** — Gate 2 Chunk B2 FULLY COMPLETE at backend commit `8315c11` (S481). Public v2 PATCH/DELETE surface for persons + organizations shipped with regression coverage.
3. **BQ-CRM-SUPPORT-WORKFLOWS** — status tracked in Living State; details live on the entity until review closes.
4. These BQs remain part of the Tier 2 lane. Scope stays in each BQ's Gate 1/2 specs until review closes.

**Phase 5 — Testing and polish (future)**:
1. **BQ-CRM-TESTING** (P0, reopened) — begins after Tier 2 completes
2. **BQ-CRM-ENTERPRISE-FEATURES** (P2, scope reduced after SUPPORT-WORKFLOWS carve-out) — custom fields, workflows, lead scoring
3. **V1→V2 migration** → party_id becomes sole identifier

**Cross-cutting (any phase)**:
- BQ-ALEMBIC-BASELINE-REWRITE (P2, not on CRM critical path)
- BQ-ALEMBIC-FILENAME-CONVENTION (P2)

---

**Phase D — CRM V2 legacy read-elimination + table drop (ACTIVE; canonical tracker `config:crm-phase-d-tracker`)**:

Phase D is the execution of the V1->V2 cutover named in §1 (V1/V2 Bridge State). Goal: eliminate every legacy `select(CRM*)` read so the legacy tables (`crm_entities`/`crm_people`/`crm_organizations`/`crm_tasks`/`crm_email_drafts`) can be dropped. Sequence: (1) eliminate legacy reads chunk-by-chunk (party model becomes the sole read path); (2) party-only write-cutover; (3) destructive legacy-table drop. The destructive drop is the ONLY step needing explicit Max GO + unanimous Council.

Ground truth (S1035, backend main `bb44e8a7`): 118 legacy `select(CRM*)` reads across 23 non-test files. Per-chunk gate track inherits program Gate-1 (`specs/BQ-CRM-V2-PHASE-D-LEGACY-TABLE-DROP-GATE1.md` @973ca621); each chunk runs its own Gate-2 spec -> MP build -> Gate-3 audit -> deploy -> Gate-4.

Per-chunk procedure (the repeatable pattern):
1. Scope ONE file/area; trace the legacy reads and their consumers in current source.
2. Gate-2 spec: convert legacy `select(CRM*)` to the party model. CRM ownership predicate moves from legacy `created_by_user_id` on the linked entity to the party predicate `crm_party_task.assigned_to_user_id` (admin/internal-api-key callers keep their owner-filter bypass). Auth surface -> unanimous Council.
3. MP build (builder != reviewer) + tests (owner pass / non-owner 404 / NULL-assignee scoped 404 / admin+api-key access / soft-deleted 404 / grep-assertion zero legacy selects in the file).
4. Gate-3 ACCESS-REGRESSION AUDIT (read-only prod, mandatory whenever the ownership predicate changes):
   - Audit A: count non-deleted `crm_party_task` with `assigned_to_user_id IS NULL`.
   - Audit B: non-deleted party tasks whose legacy owner (`COALESCE(crm_people.created_by_user_id, crm_organizations.created_by_user_id)` resolved via `crm_party_task.legacy_entity_id`) is a NON-admin user but `assigned_to_user_id` is NULL or different. PASS = Audit B returns 0.
   - If Audit B > 0: run an access-preserving backfill (set `assigned_to_user_id` = legacy owner) for exactly those rows, NULL-only guard so an existing non-null assignee is never overwritten, transaction-wrapped with a POST recount that must reach 0 before COMMIT. A backfill is a production data change -> unanimous Council + surfaced to Max. Run the backfill BEFORE the code deploys (else those owners lose access). Audit/backfill scripts: `scripts/crm_phase_d_chunk2_access_audit.sql`, `scripts/crm_phase_d_chunk2_access_backfill.sql` (run read-only/write via `AUTHOR_DISPATCH_DATABASE_URL`, the prod `ai_market_pg` public proxy).
5. Merge -> Railway deploy -> Gate-4 (health + the affected endpoints + grep-assertion zero legacy reads on main).

**Read-flag default invariant (`GLOBAL_DEFAULT_FAMILIES`) — S1046**:
`app/domains/crm/phase_b/read_flags.py` resolves each family's read mode from env vars in precedence order. The per-family vars (`CRM_V2_READ_<SURFACE>_<FAMILY>`, `CRM_V2_READ_<FAMILY>`) apply to every family. The surface-level (`CRM_V2_READ_<SURFACE>`) and global (`CRM_V2_READ_MODE`) fallbacks apply ONLY to families listed in `GLOBAL_DEFAULT_FAMILIES` — the original 9: interaction, task, email_draft, conversation_state, referral, learned_preference, playbook, briefing, steward. Any family NOT in that set — including every family added in future — defaults to `legacy` unless an explicit per-family var is set. **Add a family to `GLOBAL_DEFAULT_FAMILIES` only when a deliberate global cutover for it is intended.**

Why this exists: before S1046, `_env_names` fell through to the global `CRM_V2_READ_MODE` for ANY family, so `person`/`organization` would have silently resolved to `party_only` (auto-activating on customer data) the instant a consuming chunk wired them — no per-family flip, no bake window. The S1046 fix (`cb305cc1`) gates the surface/global fallbacks behind the allowlist; the 9 pre-existing families resolve byte-for-byte unchanged. **Operational consequence for the person/org read-elim chunks**: when a chunk wires `person`/`organization` reads, flip them ON deliberately and per-family (`CRM_V2_READ_PERSON`/`CRM_V2_READ_ORGANIZATION`) WITH the standard bake window — they no longer auto-activate.

Chunk status:
- Chunk 1 (`app/domains/crm/operations/service.py` — `get_party_interactions`/`get_party_tasks`): SHIPPED S1025, merged `9a73de83`.
- Chunk 2 (`app/api/deps.py` — `get_owned_task`, `get_owned_task_for_draft`, `get_owned_draft`): SHIPPED S1037, merged `28e4be14`. Three ownership guards now read party-only (`CrmPartyTask`/`CrmPartyEmailDraft`); the `get_owned_draft` legacy `CRMEmailDraft` fallback removed (prod had 0 legacy email drafts). Gate-3 Audit B found 7 access-loss rows (all `max@ai.market` NULL-assignee tasks); the access-preserving backfill set their assignee to Max (Audit B 7->0) before deploy. Note: 12 other non-deleted NULL-assignee tasks were intentionally left unassigned (their legacy owner is admin, so no scoped-user access loss — they remain admin/api-key reachable only).
- Chunk 3 (`app/api/v1/endpoints/crm.py` — `get_entity_context` pending-tasks read + `admin_list_pending_tasks`): SHIPPED S1038, merged `2beb477b`. The two task-family reads now route through `get_read_route("rest","task")` / `get_read_route("internal","task")` to `CrmPartyTask` with transient legacy fallback (removed at `party_only`). `admin_list_pending_tasks` derives `entity_name` via a faithful `Party.display_name` -> person/org-name -> `"Unknown"` fallback and keeps NO per-assignee filter (admin sees all incl NULL-assignee). Gate-2 unanimous APPROVE_WITH_NITS (R2 fold). Gate-3 DeepSeek APPROVE + GLM APPROVE_WITH_NITS. Gate-3 access-regression audit: non-deleted PENDING parity exact (legacy 45 == party 45), per-entity coverage 0 vanish, NO backfill needed — the raw legacy admin count (47) included 2 soft-deleted tasks the legacy read leaked (no `deleted_at` filter); the party read correctly excludes them (a latent-bug fix, safe direction). Railway deploy SUCCESS, /health green, both endpoints 401 clean. Scoped to the task family ONLY: the other 9 `endpoints/crm.py` reads are deferred — person/org reads (`telegram_open_task`) need a `person`/`organization` `READ_FAMILIES` entry built first (own chunk); `import_lovable_crm` + `patch_entity` are write-path lookups belonging to the WRITE-cutover track. 3 cosmetic Gate-3 nits (is_overdue tz-compare is legacy-parity; getattr-concat import; redundant selectinload) deferred to the next `endpoints/crm.py` chunk.
- Scaffold (`person`/`organization` read families — S1040): SHIPPED INERT S1046, merged `5c0717b3`. Purely additive read-path scaffold (PartyPerson/PartyOrganization read route + `_person_compat`/`_organization_compat` mappers + `person`/`organization` added to `READ_FAMILIES`); no consumer wired, flags default `legacy`, no owner-scope removed, no legacy swap, no schema/backfill. Gate-3 unanimous, deployed inert (/health green). Unblocks the owner-scope-removal sub-program (`build:bq-crm-v2-phase-d-owner-scope-removal-s1043`) and the per-file person/org consuming chunks.
- Read-flag new-family default fix (S1046): SHIPPED, merged `cb305cc1`. Gate-4 caught that the scaffold's `person`/`organization` families resolved to `party_only` via the global `CRM_V2_READ_MODE` fallback rather than `legacy` (harmless only because no consumer was wired). Durable code fix: `GLOBAL_DEFAULT_FAMILIES` allowlist (see the invariant above). Unanimous Gate-3; Gate-4 verified under prod env (person->legacy, organization->legacy; the 9 existing families unchanged). BQ `build:bq-crm-v2-read-flag-new-family-default-s1046` COMPLETED.
- Owner-scope removal sub-program (`build:bq-crm-v2-phase-d-owner-scope-removal-s1043`): SHIPPED S1059, merged `1ed5309f`, deployed flags OFF. Per Max S1040 the CRM is single-operator (Max + AI), so the legacy per-user owner-scope FILTER (`CRMPerson`/`CRMOrganization.created_by_user_id ==`) is multi-tenant machinery with no second tenant — removed in ONE coherent change across 5 files (`deps.py` `_crm_owner_filter`, `crm_service.py`, `crm_steward_skills.py`, `crm_referral_service.py`, `crm_briefing_service_gmail.py`). This is removal of a per-user FILTER, NOT a change to authentication (CRM endpoints still require login; buyers/sellers never reach the CRM) and NOT the read-family swap (legacy `select` stays; flags stay OFF). Explicitly preserved: `CRMTask.assigned_to_user_id` task-assignment scoping, `CRMInteraction`/`CrmPartyInteraction.created_by_user_id` interaction scoping, and `created_by_user_id=` write-provenance. Side-effect: the 16 null-owner people + 3 null-owner orgs that were invisible to the scoped path are now visible to the operator (latent-bug fix, safe direction). Full unanimous Council (Gate-1/2/3 all unanimous; MP excluded at Gate-3 as builder); Gate-3 access-control audit on `0bad9b73`. M5 residual-predicate grep + A7 indirect-helper grep are the standing Gate-3 checks for this surface and both return EMPTY on main.
- Briefing read-routing chunk (`app/services/crm_briefing_service_gmail.py` — `build:bq-crm-v2-phase-d-read-routing-chunk-briefing-s1061`): ACTIVATED S1062, routing merged `ea0f2215` (prod `a61159c0`). The 3 data-returning person/org display reads in `_build_briefings_from_tasks` (person get-by-id; org via `person.organization_id`; org via `entity_id`) now route through `get_read_route(...,"person")`/`get_read_route(...,"organization")` to the scaffold `get_person_by_id`/`get_organization_by_id` with retained legacy fallback. The L124 `select(CRMTask.id)` legacy-fallback detector is deliberately left legacy. Activation followed `config:ceremony-sizing-policy` (Max S1061): no calendar bake — exhaustive full-dataset parity (real prod `ai_market_pg` via `scripts/test-db-dsn.sh`: 384 people + 29 orgs, 0 dangerous mismatches; party matches legacy byte-for-byte, misses fall back to legacy) gated the flip. `CRM_V2_READ_PERSON`/`CRM_V2_READ_ORGANIZATION` set to `party_first` on Railway (deploy `c0b5d8b4` SUCCESS, /health green, `alembic_drift` false); `get_read_route` confirmed `party_first`+fallback for both families across all surfaces. Rollback = set legacy/unset (instant, no code deploy). Gates 1/2 full-panel unanimous; post-build audit right-sized to one reviewer (AG APPROVE) per the policy. BQ COMPLETED (Gate-4).
- gmail_draft person-read chunk (`app/services/gmail_draft_service.py::_resolve_contact_email` — `build:bq-crm-v2-phase-d-read-routing-chunk-gmail-draft-s1062`): SHIPPED S1062, merged `40d8eb84`. The single data-returning person get-by-id now routes through `get_read_route("internal","person")` → scaffold `get_person_by_id` with retained legacy `select(CRMPerson)` fallback (mirrors the briefing person branch). The method consumes only `email`/`full_name`, both on `_person_compat`; post-fetch contract (not-found→`ContactResolutionError`, blank-email→error, return `(person,email)`) byte-unchanged. No new flag (`CRM_V2_READ_PERSON` already `party_first` from R11); behavior-preserving (person-family parity proven); instant rollback (flag legacy/unset or revert). Right-sized per `config:ceremony-sizing-policy`: MP build + AG single-reviewer APPROVE; 5 new routing tests green; Railway `43b64eef` SUCCESS, /health green. BQ COMPLETED (Gate-4).
- Remaining (after Chunk 3): `crm_service.py` (28, likely wholesale-retire), `crm_steward_skills.py` (21), `endpoints/crm.py` (9 — person/org `telegram_open_task` reads (the person/org `READ_FAMILIES` entry now exists post-S1040 scaffold; these route once an owner-scope-removal chunk wires them) + `import_lovable_crm`/`patch_entity` write-path reads), `mcp/crm_remote.py` (7), `outreach_*` (11), plus smaller files. Then the party-only write-cutover, then the destructive drop. (~110 legacy `select(CRM*)` reads remain.)
